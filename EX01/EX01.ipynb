    "## The Snowplow Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**  \n",
    "A snowplow must clean the snow from the front of `n` houses arrayed along a one-dimensional road. The position of each house is denoted by a floating-point number. Initially positioned at the origin (0), the snowplow aims to minimize the average waiting time for all houses, where waiting time for a house is defined as the time elapsed before the snow is cleaned in front of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- The snowplow starts at position 0.\n",
    "- The position of houses can be any floating-point number, positive or negative.\n",
    "- The order of cleaning affects the average waiting time for the houses.\n",
    "- The goal is to optimize the cleaning route to minimize this average waiting time.\n"

    "## Step 1: Configuration Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Select a value for `n` within [5, 10] and propose a configuration of house positions that demonstrates the non-optimality of simple sorting or greedy approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan:**  \n",
    "- Choose `n = 7` for manageable complexity while allowing diverse scenarios.\n",
    "- Propose specific positions for these houses to illustrate the complexity of the problem where neither standard sorting nor a straightforward greedy method (selecting the closest house next) is optimal.\n",
    "- Discuss the proposed configuration briefly before implementation.\n"
